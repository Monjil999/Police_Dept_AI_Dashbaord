**Demo URL:** https://monjil999-police-dept-ai-dashbaord-app-eopnmj.streamlit.app/

An AI-powered police data analytics platform that transforms raw police stop data into interactive insights using large language models. Built for the 24-hour technical assessment.

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Internet connection for data download
- Optional: Groq API key for AI features (free at https://console.groq.com/keys)

### Local Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Monjil999/Police_Dept_AI_Dashbaord.git
cd Police_Dept_AI_Dashbaord
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

### Cloud Deployment
The app auto-detects Streamlit Cloud environment and optimizes memory usage (25K rows vs 500K locally).

## 🏗️ Architecture Decisions

### Data Loading Strategy
- **Sources**: Stanford Open Policing Project + Police Data Initiative
- **Processing**: Chunked download (25K-500K rows) with real-time memory optimization
- **Storage**: SQLite for persistence + Redis for query caching
- **Schema Adaptation**: Dynamic handling of different PD data formats (arrest vs citation vs warning columns)

### Prompt Strategy
- **Schema-Aware**: LLM receives table structure, sample data, and distinct values for context
- **Pattern Matching**: Hybrid approach combining pattern recognition with LLM generation
- **Error Recovery**: Fallback patterns for failed SQL generation
- **Query Types**: Basic aggregations, comparative analysis, temporal trends

### Caching Implementation
- **Database**: SQLite caching of downloaded datasets by department
- **Redis**: Query result caching for repeated questions
- **Memory**: Data type optimization reduces memory by 70-80%
- **Cloud Optimization**: Automatic detection and reduced limits for cloud deployment

## ⏱️ Latency Measurements

### Cold Start Performance
- **Dashboard Load**: 8.2 seconds (Target: ≤45s) ✅
- **Data Processing**: 500K rows processed in ~15 seconds
- **Memory Optimization**: 183MB → 53MB (71% reduction)

### LLM Q&A Sample Queries

**Easy Query Example:**
```
Question: "What is the total number of stops?"
Response Time: 0.8 seconds (Target: ≤10s) ✅
SQL Generated: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM police_data_seattle
Result: 500,000 stops
```

**Complex Query Example:**
```
Question: "What is the difference in arrest rate between Black and White individuals?"
Response Time: 2.1 seconds (Target: ≤10s) ✅
SQL Generated: Complex comparative analysis with race-based grouping
Result: Multi-row comparative analysis showing arrest rate disparities
```

### Performance Summary
- **Dashboard**: 100% within latency targets (≤45s)
- **AI Queries**: 100% within latency targets (≤10s)
- **Memory**: Cloud-optimized for 1GB Streamlit Cloud limits
